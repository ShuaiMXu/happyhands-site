# Grid

The columns and gutters a page sits on, at every width.

## Rules
1. grid-layout-tokens MUST Use --container, --sidebar, --toc and --topbar for layout widths; never a raw number. Because a raw width drifts from the shell, so the page edge no longer lines up with the header and nav.
   - Correct: `<div className="max-w-(--container)">`
   - Wrong: `<div className="max-w-[1120px]">`
2. grid-no-sideways-scroll MUST Keep the page from scrolling sideways at 320px; tables and code scroll inside their own container. Because one wide table makes the whole page pan, and on a phone the person loses the nav and the first column together.
   - Correct: `<CodeBlock code={longCommand}/>  // scrolls inside`
   - Wrong: `<main><pre>{longCommand}</pre></main>`
3. grid-full-bleed SHOULD Break a full-bleed section out of the container and return its content to the container on the same gutter. Because content that rides the bleed edge no longer lines up with the text above and below it.
4. grid-measure SHOULD Stop prose at --measure (68ch); tables, previews and grey panels take the full column. Because lines past about 70 characters make the eye lose its place on the return.
5. grid-lines-clear NEVER Set content on a drawn grid line; guides are ink at 8% along the container edges. Because a line through text or a control reads as a strike-through or a border the element does not have.
   - Correct: `<div className="px-6"><h2>Runs</h2></div>`
   - Wrong: `<div className="border-l border-hair pl-0"><h2>Runs</h2></div>`
