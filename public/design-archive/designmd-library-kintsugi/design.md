## Overview

Kintsugi visual system, translated from the Claude Artisan catalog for use in digital products. Dark matte ceramic/glaze surfaces (charcoal, near-black) as the base material; Luminous gold seam lines marking every join, division, or repair — imperfection as a visible feature

- **Category:** historical
- **Era:** 15th century–present
- **Origin:** Japanese art of repairing broken ceramics with gold-dusted lacquer (urushi), rooted in wabi-sabi philosophy — the break and its repair become part of the object's history.
- **Reference:** Muromachi-period repaired tea bowls (chawan) in the Freer Gallery and Tokyo National Museum collections.
- **Structural base:** superfície material com conteúdo em camadas

**Defining traits:**
- Dark matte ceramic/glaze surfaces (charcoal, near-black) as the base material
- Luminous gold seam lines marking every join, division, or repair — imperfection as a visible feature
- Warm charcoal-and-gold palette only, with slightly irregular hand-drawn seam paths

## Colors

- **bg** — #1c1a18
- **surface** — #262320
- **surface-2** — #322d28
- **text** — #f0e6d2
- **text-muted** — #b8ab94
- **primary** — #d4a53d
- **accent** — #8a6a3a
- **seam** — #f0c04d
- **lacquer** — #100e0c

## Typography

- Display: Shippori Mincho, Noto Serif JP, serif
- Body: Noto Serif JP, Shippori Mincho, Georgia, serif
- Mono: ui-monospace, monospace

## Layout

- superfície material com conteúdo em camadas
- Use a responsive grid and preserve content hierarchy.
- Collapse columns below 768px without horizontal overflow.

## Elevation & Depth

- Dark matte ceramic/glaze surfaces (charcoal, near-black) as the base material; Luminous gold seam lines marking every join, division, or repair — imperfection as a visible feature; Warm charcoal-and-gold palette only, with slightly irregular hand-drawn seam paths; sombras e elevação; transparência e blur

## Shapes

- Radius scale: 3px, 10px, 18px.

## Components

- Buttons keep visible focus and predictable hover/pressed states.
- Cards use the surface and radius scale from the tokens.
- Forms expose persistent labels, textual errors, and keyboard focus.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do: follow the tokens and the structural composition.
- Do: maintain WCAG AA contrast and `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Avoid: using the style as decoration without functional hierarchy.
