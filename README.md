[Star history](https://www.star-history.com/?repos=ShuaiMXu%2Fhappyhands-site&type=date) | [Core workbench](https://github.com/ShuaiMXu/happyhands)

The public website for HappyHands: product guidance, design systems, Design.md references, and component previews. The local workbench and Harness are maintained separately in [happyhands](https://github.com/ShuaiMXu/happyhands).

HappyHands 官网提供产品指引、设计系统、Design.md 参考和组件预览。本地工作台与 Harness 由核心仓库独立维护。

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Portal: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/apps/portal/`
- Product entry: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/apps/portal/`
- Workbench: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/apps/designer/?case=happyclaw`
- Design resources: `http://127.0.0.1:4173/components/`

## Retired Theme Studio

The public Theme Studio has been retired. `/apps/studio/` displays a retirement
notice, not an editor. Existing browser drafts are not deleted. The editor source,
adapted [tweakcn](https://github.com/jnsahaj/tweakcn) engine pinned to `a3b47b37`,
and contracts remain in this repository for maintenance and compatibility.

Use the [design resource library](https://happyhands.cc/en/components/) for design
references, system documents and component source. Follow the
[local workbench guide](https://happyhands.cc/en/guide/) to connect your project;
confirm design rules and scope before implementation.

主题工作室已停用，旧地址仅显示停用说明；现有浏览器草稿与编辑器源码保留。
请使用[设计资源库](https://happyhands.cc/components/)查看参考与组件，并按
[本地工作台指南](https://happyhands.cc/guide/)接入项目。

[Studio architecture](docs/studio-architecture.md) and
[tweakcn integration](docs/tweakcn-integration.md) describe the retained historical
implementation, not currently available website features. Preserve
[source attribution](packages/theme-core/vendor/NOTICE.md).

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run test:studio  # retained source and contract tests
npm run build
```

## Data flow

The Review Workbench is read-only for run data. Runs are produced in the
[happyhands](https://github.com/ShuaiMXu/happyhands) harness and published with
`pnpm harness export`, which copies an allow-list (manifest, spec, captures,
screenshots, skill results, reviews) into `public/runs/`. Nothing here edits a
run; judgments are recorded in the harness CLI.

Portal content lives in `apps/portal/content.js`; reusable render functions live
in `apps/portal/components.js`. The hero and Screens section use only exported
happyhands run captures. Product claims link back to the core repository,
issues or Workbench evidence.

## Brand foundation

The portal uses the HappyHands identity and design-system semantics: ink and
paper establish hierarchy, brand orange is reserved for a small point of
emphasis, and product actions remain neutral. Chinese and Latin copy share a
PingFang-first sans-serif stack; the portal uses no serif typeface. The
official dark-background logo and mark live in `public/brand/`.

## Local Web Alpha

The website provides setup guidance and read-only historical examples. Install happyhands dependencies and run `pnpm workbench`; enter your repository directory and key user task in the local workbench. Project DESIGN.md, tokens and component code remain the design sources. Confirm rules and scope before isolated edits; independently review the result before a human decision. The current scoped example is [the approved HappyClaw command-hint change](https://github.com/ShuaiMXu/happyhands/blob/main/docs/counter-evidence-review-2026-10-21.md). Its original disputed review remains in history and does not imply human acceptance or deployment.

`/apps/web/` is a historical compatibility URL that redirects to the portal; legacy exploration pages may retain those links. The old read-only site workbench is not the current local application.

Builds publish `release.json` with the source revision and known/unknown dirty state. `npm run verify:alpha` checks built routes and source identity; it does not establish production performance or visual quality. See [dependency audit](docs/dependency-audit-2026-10-18.md) for the remaining development-test advisories.

### 官网到本地工作台

接入区可填写仓库目录、任务和项目内 DESIGN.md/token/组件源码路径，通过 loopback 工作台链接交接。先运行主仓库 `pnpm workbench`，本地确认后复用原 onboard 流程；官网的“查看本次记录”恢复同一持久任务/run。没有跨域本地 API 调用，也不会从链接自动批准规范或执行代码。数据保留在当前标签页 sessionStorage，源码只在本地读取。需配套包含 site-handoff 协议的新版本主仓库。退休 Studio 的既有浏览器草稿不会被清除，官网不再提供编辑或导出入口。

协议集成校验：`node --test tests/site-handoff.test.mjs`（主仓库默认 `../happyhands`，可用 `HARNESS_ROOT` 指定）。
