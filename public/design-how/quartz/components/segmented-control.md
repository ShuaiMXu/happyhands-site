# Segmented control

Switches between a few views of one thing.

## Use when
- Two to five views of the same content: time range, conversation state, monthly or yearly.
- Filters that combine, such as errors and warnings shown together (multiple).

## Don't use when
- The views are separate pages or panels with their own content. Use [Tabs](/systems/quartz/components/tabs.md).
- The choice is a form value saved later. Use [Radio group](/systems/quartz/components/radio-group.md).
- There are more than five options. Use [Select](/systems/quartz/components/select.md).
- One setting is on or off. Use [Switch](/systems/quartz/components/switch.md).

## Minimal example
```tsx
<SegmentedControl aria-label="Time range" defaultValue="24h">
  <SegmentedControlItem value="1h">1h</SegmentedControlItem>
  <SegmentedControlItem value="24h">24h</SegmentedControlItem>
</SegmentedControl>
```

## Rules
Ordered by priority. MUST and NEVER break the system if skipped. SHOULD is style.

1. segmented-control-name MUST Name the control with aria-label or aria-labelledby. Because the control is a radiogroup, so without a name a screen reader announces "24h, radio" with no question.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControl aria-label="Time range" defaultValue="24h">`
   - Wrong: `<SegmentedControl defaultValue="24h">`
2. segmented-control-default MUST Pass defaultValue or value in single mode; it is empty until the first press and cannot be cleared. Because with nothing selected the view has no state to show, and a radio cannot be cleared back to none.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControl defaultValue="24h">...</SegmentedControl>`
   - Wrong: `<SegmentedControl>...</SegmentedControl>`
3. segmented-control-count SHOULD Pass count on each segment when the views hold different amounts, and countMax for a live count.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControlItem value="waiting" count={waiting} countMax={999}>Waiting on you</SegmentedControlItem>`
4. segmented-control-short-labels SHOULD Write one or two words per segment, of about equal length.
   - Correct: `"1h", "24h", "7d"`
   - Wrong: `"1h", "Last 24 hours", "7d"`
5. segmented-control-max-five MUST Use Select past five segments; the control cannot wrap or scroll. Because a sixth segment overflows the box on a narrow screen, since the control never wraps or shrinks a label below 6 characters.
   - Correct: `<Select items={languages}/>`
   - Wrong: `<SegmentedControl>{languages.map(...)}</SegmentedControl>`
6. segmented-control-icon-name MUST Set aria-label on a segment that holds only an icon. Because the glyph has no text, so a screen reader announces an unnamed radio.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControlItem value="list" aria-label="List"><Icon icon={List} size={16}/></SegmentedControlItem>`
7. segmented-control-no-hue NEVER Fill a segment with a kind's hue; the selected segment is always a paper thumb on the grey track, and the kind goes in a Badge beside the control. Because the lifted thumb is how a person sees the choice, and a pastel segment reads as a label, not a selected one.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControlItem value="refund">Refunds</SegmentedControlItem>`
   - Wrong: `<SegmentedControlItem value="refund" className="bg-accent-tint">Refunds</SegmentedControlItem>`
8. segmented-control-no-slide NEVER Animate a pill sliding between segments; the selection cuts. Because the selected fill is the segment itself, so a thumb drawn apart lags arrow keys and drops the forced-colors frame.
   - Correct: `<SegmentedControl defaultValue="24h">...</SegmentedControl>`
   - Wrong: `<motion.div layoutId="pill"/>`

## API
| Prop | Type | Default | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| `multiple` | `boolean` | `false` | false is a radio group; true is a toggle group. |
| `value / defaultValue` | `string \| string[]` |  | The selected segment, or segments with multiple. |
| `onValueChange` | `(value) => void` |  | Fires on arrow keys too in single mode. |
| `size` | `'xs' \| 'sm' \| 'default'` | `'default'` | 24, 28 or 32px minimum; grows with 200% text. |
| `fill` | `boolean` | `false` | Stretch to the container; segments share the width. |
| `countMax` | `number` |  | Widest expected count; its width is reserved. |
| `Item count` | `number` |  | Tabular figures after the label, read as the description. |
| `Item kind` | `'agent' \| 'key' \| 'run' \| 'deploy' \| 'model'` |  | Sets data-kind only, for the things inside the segment; the selected thumb stays paper and no segment takes a hue. |
| `Item value, disabled, aria-label` | `string, boolean, string` |  | aria-label is required for an icon-only segment. |
Other props pass through to the root element.

## Variants and states
- multiple: false, true
- fill: false, true
- size: xs, sm, default
- states: rest, hover, pressed, focus-visible, selected, disabled, one segment disabled, multiple none pressed

## Accessibility
- [ ] The root is a radiogroup, or a group with multiple, named by aria-label.
- [ ] Each segment is a radio, or a button with aria-pressed in multiple mode.
- [ ] The control is one tab stop; Tab focuses the selected segment.
- [ ] Arrow keys move and select in single mode and move focus only in multiple mode; arrows skip disabled segments.
- [ ] Space and Enter select a segment, or toggle it in multiple mode.
- [ ] The count is aria-hidden and read as the segment description.
- [ ] Forced colors keep a Highlight fill on the selected segment and GrayText on disabled ones.

## Edge cases
- Long label -> The label box fades its last 16px, the title carries the full text, and segments shrink to a floor.
- Seven labels in 320px -> The track cannot wrap or scroll and runs past its container. Use Select past five.
- Count passes 99 to 100 -> The slot is reserved for countMax, so no segment moves.
- Right to left -> Segments mirror and arrow keys follow the visual order.
- Zoom 200% -> The track is max(--control, 1lh + 12px) and grows with the text.
- No value in single mode -> Nothing is selected until the first press; it cannot return to none.
- On the inverse surface -> In the dark theme the thumb lifts 20% toward ink and gains a 16% ring.
- Slow or failed view -> The view shows its own loading or error under the control; the control stays put.
