## Overview

Feature showcase landing page. Ideal for marketing, conversão, lead gen. AI-ready template. Remember when SaaS pages were just a hero, three icons, and a pricing table? That era died somewhere around 2018. Stripe rewrote the rules — suddenly every product page needed animated gradients, layered feature sections, and enough visual density to feel like a product demo without ever opening the app. Linear pushed it further: dark canvases, tight grids, features presented as artifacts rather than bullet points.

The shift wasn't just aesthetic. Products got genuinely complex. You can't sell a platform with a tagline anymore. Teams realized that feature showcases — done well — replace sales calls. The page becomes the demo. Grid layouts let you present twelve capabilities without it reading like a spec sheet. Benefit cards give each feature breathing room and hierarchy.

What we landed on by the early 2020s is a format: dense but scannable, visual but informative. The best examples feel like editorial design applied to product marketing. Not a wall of text. Not a slideshow. Something in between that respects both the product's depth and the reader's time.

- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.

- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos
