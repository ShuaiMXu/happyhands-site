# Skeleton

Holds the space of content that is still loading.

## Use when
- Content with a known shape is loading: rows, a header, a chart frame.
- The load usually takes 150ms to a few seconds.

## Don't use when
- The shape is unknown, or the wait is a task with an amount. Use [Progress](/systems/quartz/components/progress.md).
- A button waits on its own action. Use [Button](/systems/quartz/components/button.md).
- The load failed. Use [Empty state](/systems/quartz/components/empty-state.md).

## Minimal example
```tsx
<SkeletonSwap loading={loading} fallback={<RunRowSkeleton/>} label="Loading runs"><RunRow/></SkeletonSwap>
```

## Rules
Ordered by priority. MUST and NEVER break the system if skipped. SHOULD is style.

1. skeleton-swap MUST Wrap loading content in SkeletonSwap, not a loading ternary; DataTable, Chart and Stat take their own loading prop instead. Because a bare ternary flashes the skeleton on a 40ms response and blanks the content on every refetch.
   - Correct: `<SkeletonSwap loading={loading} fallback={<RunRowSkeleton/>}><RunRow/></SkeletonSwap>`
   - Wrong: `{loading ? <RunRowSkeleton/> : <RunRow/>}`
2. skeleton-type-match MUST Use SkeletonText with the same type role and line count as the real text. Because each line is 1lh of its role, so a wrong role or a fixed h-4 box makes the rows jump when the text arrives.
   - Correct: `<SkeletonText type="label" className="w-48"/>`
   - Wrong: `<Skeleton className="h-4 w-48"/>`
3. skeleton-label-noun SHOULD Set SkeletonSwap label to what is loading: 'Loading runs'.
   - Correct: `<SkeletonSwap label="Loading runs">`
   - Wrong: `<SkeletonSwap label="Please wait…">`
4. skeleton-hidden MUST Keep skeletons aria-hidden and let SkeletonSwap announce once. Because a role or label on each block makes a screen reader read "loading" once per row.
   - Correct: `<SkeletonSwap label="Loading keys" loading={loading} fallback={<KeysSkeleton/>}>`
   - Wrong: `<div role="img" aria-label="loading"><Skeleton/></div>`
5. skeleton-no-sweep NEVER Add a pulse or sweeping gradient to a Skeleton; the block is still. Because a sweep across a dozen rows pulls the eye from the content that has loaded and ignores reduced motion.
   - Correct: `<Skeleton className="h-(--control) w-24"/>`
   - Wrong: `<Skeleton className="animate-[pulse_2s_infinite] bg-gradient-to-r"/>`
6. skeleton-row-count SHOULD Render only as many skeleton rows as fit the region, at most 8.
   - Correct: `Array.from({length: 8}, () => <RowSkeleton/>)`
   - Wrong: `Array.from({length: 50}, () => <RowSkeleton/>)`
7. skeleton-size-classes SHOULD Size a Skeleton box with the classes of the real thing: size-8 for an avatar, h-(--control) for a button.
8. skeleton-timeout MUST Time out a load that never ends and show an error Empty state in the same box. Because SkeletonSwap holds the skeleton while loading stays true, so a hung request reads as loading forever.

## API
| Prop | Type | Default | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| `Skeleton` | `div props` |  | A box; size it with the real thing's classes. |
| `SkeletonText type` | `TextRole` | `'body'` | Type role it stands in for; each line is 1lh. |
| `SkeletonText lines` | `number` | `1` | How many lines; 0 renders 1. |
| `SkeletonText last` | `number` | `0.6` | Width of the last line as a fraction. |
| `SkeletonSwap loading` | `boolean` | `required` | After content has shown, a reload keeps it and marks it stale. |
| `SkeletonSwap fallback` | `ReactNode` | `required` | The skeleton. |
| `SkeletonSwap delay` | `number` | `150` | ms the skeleton stays invisible, space held. |
| `SkeletonSwap minDuration` | `number` | `400` | ms it stays once shown. |
| `SkeletonSwap label` | `string` | `'Loading'` | Announced once the skeleton shows. |
Other props pass through to the root element.

## Variants and states
- type: heading-lg, heading-sm, body, body-sm, label, code-sm
- box: avatar, button, image
- states: held invisible, shown, held after load, done, stale

## Accessibility
- [ ] Skeleton and SkeletonText are aria-hidden and take no focus.
- [ ] The swap region sets aria-busy while held or stale.
- [ ] A role="status" region announces the label once, when the skeleton shows; a reload announces nothing.
- [ ] Forced colors paint the fill GrayText so the shape stays visible.

## Edge cases
- One-line stub at w-8 -> Stays a visible 32px stub.
- lines={0} -> Clamps to one line so no zero-height block shifts later.
- Container 120px -> Text lines shrink to the container; fixed boxes keep their size.
- Right to left -> Lines start at the inline start; the short last line ends early on the left.
- Zoom 200% -> Line heights follow the role and still match the text.
- Response inside 150ms -> Swaps straight to content; the skeleton never shows.
- Loaded within 400ms of showing -> The skeleton stays to its minimum so it does not blink.
- Reload after content shown -> Content stays, aria-busy at once, 60% opacity after 150ms; no skeleton.
- Load never ends -> Skeleton and aria-busy stay forever; the caller times out.
- Inside a well or table -> The fill is the grey field, so it nearly vanishes on grey; keep skeletons on paper.
