## Overview

Realistic, textured interface with 3D depth, real-world metaphors (leather, wood, metal), complex gradients (8-12 stops), realistic shadows, grain/texture overlays, tactile press animations. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Between 2007 and 2012, Apple's interface design was obsessed with making digital things look real. The Notes app had yellow legal pad lines. Game Center was wrapped in wood grain and green felt. iCal wore stitched leather. Steve Jobs believed that if software looked like something you already understood, you'd trust it faster. And honestly? He was right. People who'd never touched a smartphone knew what a bookshelf full of books meant.

Then Jony Ive took over software in 2013 and burned it all down with iOS 7. The argument was simple: people don't need training wheels anymore. Flat won. Skeuomorphism became a punchline at design conferences for nearly a decade.

But here we are in 2025, and it's back. Not as a copy of the old Apple stuff, but as a deliberate aesthetic choice. Spatial computing needs depth cues that flat design simply cannot provide. VisionOS uses subtle shadows, glass refraction, real lighting. Designers building for AR and mixed reality are rediscovering that texture and dimension aren't decoration. They're wayfinding.

- Density: 5/10 — Balanced
- Variance: 4/10 — Moderate
- Motion: 8/10 — Cinematic

- **Style:** Realistic, Tactile, Textured, Detailed
- **Keywords:** Realistic, texture, depth, 3D appearance, real-world metaphors, shadows, gradients, tactile, detailed, material
- **Era:** 2007-2012 iOS
- **Light/Dark:** ◐ Partial / ◐ Partial

## Colors

- Palette derived from style keywords and era context


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Realistic shadows (layers), depth (perspective), texture details (noise, grain), realistic animations (300-500ms)

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Realistic textures applied
- Do Complex gradients 8-12 stops
- Do Multi-layer shadows
- Do Texture overlays present
- Do Tactile animations smooth
- Do Depth effect pronounced


## Use Case

Landing pages, SaaS
