## Overview

Brutalist design with raw, unpolished, stark aesthetic. Ideal for creative portfolio, design agency, experimental blog, digital art. AI-ready template. The name comes from béton brut — raw concrete. Le Corbusier wasn't trying to be ugly. He was trying to be honest. The Brutalist architects of the 1950s stripped buildings down to structure and material because they believed ornamentation was a lie. Agree or not, the conviction was real.

Web brutalism hit its stride around 2016. Bloomberg's site redesign shocked people. Craigslist suddenly looked intentional rather than outdated. Designers started asking: what if we just... didn't polish things? What if the grid showed through? What if Times New Roman was a choice?

Now in 2026 we're deep into Anti-Design 2.0 — a second wave that's less about shock value and more about rejecting the sameness of design systems that all converged on the same rounded corners and soft shadows. Designers keep returning to brutalism because the web got too comfortable. Every SaaS looks identical. Brutalism is the antidote to that specific boredom. It's not rebellion for its own sake anymore. It's a legitimate design position.

## Elevation & Depth

No smooth transitions (instant), sharp corners (0px), bold typography (700+), visible grid, large blocks

- **Physics:** Ease-out curves, 200-300ms duration. Smooth and predictable.

- **Hover states:** Subtle color shift + shadow adjustment over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade only (200ms).
