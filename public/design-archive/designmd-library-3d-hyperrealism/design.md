## Overview

Build an immersive 3D interface using realistic textures, 3D models (Three.js/Babylon.js), complex shadows, realistic lighting, parallax scrolling (3-5 layers), physics-based motion. Ideal for premium e-commerce, real estate, automotive, immersive education. AI-ready template. Remember when iOS 6 had that leather texture on the calendar app? Skeuomorphism died a loud death in 2013, and we spent the next five years in flat design purgatory. Everything was a colored rectangle. But here's the thing: depth never stopped being useful, we just lost the technology to do it well in a browser.

WebGL changed that. Three.js made it accessible. By the mid-2010s, agencies were shipping product configurators and architectural walkthroughs that actually ran at 60fps. The gap between "native app experience" and "website" started closing fast. GPU acceleration on mobile caught up around 2019, and suddenly 3D wasn't just a desktop party trick.

Now in 2026, Apple Vision Pro and spatial computing have reframed the conversation entirely. We're not asking "should this be 3D?" anymore. We're asking "how does this object exist in space?" The performance cost is real though. You're shipping a rendering engine to every visitor. That's not free, and pretending otherwise is dishonest design.

- Density: 5/10 — Balanced
- Variance: 4/10 — Moderate
- Motion: 8/10 — Cinematic

- **Style:** Immersive, Realistic, Tactile, Spatial
- **Keywords:** Depth, realistic textures, 3D models, spatial navigation, tactile, skeuomorphic elements, rich detail, immersive
- **Era:** 2020s Modern
- **Light/Dark:** ◐ Partial / ◐ Partial

## Colors

- **Deep Navy** (#001F3F) — Primary surface or dominant color
- **Forest Green** (#228B22) — Secondary surface or text color
- **Burgundy** (#800020) — Supporting palette color
- **Gold** (#FFD700) — Premium accent, decorative highlights
- **Silver** (#C0C0C0) — Supporting palette color


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

WebGL/Three.js 3D, realistic shadows (layers), physics lighting, parallax (3-5 layers), smooth 3D (300-400ms)

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 540ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 120ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.




## Shapes

Base corner radius: 4px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.

## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do WebGL/Three.js integrated
- Do 3D models loaded
- Do Parallax 3-5 layers
- Do Realistic lighting verified
- Do Complex shadows rendered
- Do Physics animation smooth 300-400ms
