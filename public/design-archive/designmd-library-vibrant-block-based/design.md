## Overview

Design an energetic, vibrant interface with bold block layouts, geometric shapes, high color contrast, large typography (32px+), animated background patterns, duotone effects. Ideal for startups, ecommerce fashion, apps gaming, marketing conversível. AI-ready template. Memphis Design landed like a grenade in 1981. Ettore Sottsass and his Milan collective looked at the beige minimalism dominating furniture and interiors and said: absolutely not. They threw clashing colors together, stacked geometric shapes without apology, and treated pattern like a weapon. It was polarizing. Critics hated it. But it cracked open a door that never fully closed — the idea that design could be loud, irreverent, and still intentional.

Fast forward to the 2020s and you see the same energy resurface through Y2K revivals on the web. Designers raised on early-2000s Flash sites started pulling those aesthetics back — saturated palettes, chunky type, unapologetic scale — but now with modern CSS Grid and variable fonts backing them up. The block-based layout is the structural backbone here. It rejects the polite 12-column grid in favor of massive, self-contained sections that breathe with 48px+ gaps between them.

This isn't subtle. It's not trying to be. Block layouts treat each section as its own poster, its own moment. You scroll and each block hits you fresh. That's the lineage: Memphis irreverence meets Y2K maximalism meets modern component architecture.

## Colors

- **Neon Green** (#39FF14) — Primary surface or dominant color
- **Electric Purple** (#BF00FF) — Accent color, emphasis elements
- **Vivid Pink** (#FF1493) — Primary text color
- **Bright Cyan** (#00FFFF) — Accent highlight, links and focus states
- **Sunburst** (#FFAA00) — Supporting palette color
- **Orange** (#FF7F00) — Warm accent, call-to-action secondary
- **Shocking Pink** (#FF006E) — Primary text color
- **Lime** (#CCFF00) — Extended palette, decorative use


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Split-screen (text left, visual right).
- **Feature sections:** Zig-zag alternating text+image rows. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

Large sections (48px+ gaps), animated patterns, bold hover (color shift), scroll-snap, large type (32px+), 200-300ms

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.




## Shapes

Base corner radius: 4px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.

## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Block layout with 48px+ gaps
- Do Large typography 32px+
- Do 4-6 vibrant colors max
- Do Animated patterns active
- Do Scroll-snap enabled
- Do High contrast verified (7:1+)


## Use Case
