## Overview

Design with anti-polish raw aesthetic. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. The anti-polish movement didn't start in a Figma file. It started at copy shops, in bedrooms, with scissors and glue sticks and whatever paper was lying around. Zine culture — punk zines, riot grrrl pamphlets, underground comics — taught us that imperfection carries more truth than any grid system ever could. That energy never really left. It just went dormant while we all got drunk on clean UI.

Then AI happened. Suddenly every surface looked the same — smooth, optimized, soulless. Designers started scanning old receipts, photocopying their sketches at weird angles, pulling textures from deteriorating book covers. Not as nostalgia. As resistance. The hand-drawn line became political. The torn edge became a statement: this was made by a person, not a prompt.

What we're seeing now isn't a trend. It's a correction. The rawness isn't decorative — it's structural. It says: we reject the premise that design must be frictionless. Sometimes friction is the whole point.

- Density: 5/10 — Balanced
- Variance: 8/10 — Expressive
- Motion: 6/10 — Expressive

- **Style:** Raw, Imperfect, Authentic, Anti-Polish
- **Keywords:** Hand-drawn, collage, scanned textures, unfinished, imperfect, authentic, human, sketch, raw marks, creative process
- **Era:** 2025+ Anti-Digital
- **Light/Dark:** ✓ Full / ✓ Full

## Colors

- **Paper White** (#FAFAF8) — Light surface, card backgrounds
- **Pencil Grey** (#4A4A4A) — Secondary text, borders, muted elements
- **Marker Black** (#1A1A1A) — Dark surface, primary background
- **Kraft Brown** (#C4A77D) — Supporting palette color


## Typography

- **Display / Hero:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 700, tight tracking, used for headline impact
- **Body:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — Weight 400, 16px/1.6 line-height, max 72ch per line
- **UI Labels / Captions:** System UI stack (-apple-system, sans-serif) — 0.875rem, weight 500, slight letter-spacing
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono — Used for code, metadata, and technical values

Scale:
- Hero: clamp(2.5rem, 5vw, 4rem)
- H1: 2.25rem
- H2: 1.5rem
- Body: 1rem / 1.6
- Small: 0.875rem


## Layout

- **Grid:** CSS Grid primary. Max-width containment: 1280px centered with 1.5rem side padding.
- **Spacing rhythm:** Balanced. Base unit: 0.5rem (8px).
- **Section vertical gaps:** clamp(4rem, 8vw, 8rem).
- **Hero layout:** Asymmetric composition.
- **Feature sections:** Asymmetric grid with varied card sizes. No 3-equal-columns.
- **Mobile collapse:** All multi-column layouts collapse below 768px. No horizontal overflow.
- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

No smooth transitions, hand-drawn animations, paper texture overlays, jitter effects, sketch reveal

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 12px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Moderately rounded (0.75rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Moderately rounded (0.75rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure black (#000000) — use off-black or charcoal variants
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Textures loaded
- Do Hand-drawn elements present
- Do Imperfections intentional
- Do Authentic feel achieved
- Do Performance ok with textures
- Do Accessibility maintained
