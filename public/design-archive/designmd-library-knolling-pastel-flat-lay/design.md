## Overview

Knolling landing page, flat lay style, organized objects, pastel background, clean 90 degree alignment, overhead photography look. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Knolling started on a shop floor. Andrew Kromelow, a janitor at Frank Gehry's furniture studio in 1987, began arranging tools at right angles on flat surfaces — everything parallel, everything visible. Tom Sachs adopted the practice religiously in his studio, turning it into a creative discipline. "Always be knolling" became a mantra. The idea was simple: if you can see everything, you can think clearly.

Product photography picked it up fast. Magazines, catalogs, then Instagram. The flat-lay explosion of 2014–2018 turned every lifestyle brand into a knolling practitioner — skincare routines, desk setups, travel essentials, all shot from directly above on muted backgrounds. It was aspirational organization.

UI design absorbed this through osmosis. The same overhead perspective, the same pastel restraint, the same obsessive alignment. E-commerce cards started mimicking flat-lay compositions. Hero sections borrowed that clinical-yet-warm tension. The photography aesthetic became the interface aesthetic — soft shadows, generous whitespace, objects floating in deliberate grids. Not skeuomorphism, not brutalism. Something quieter. Something that says: we thought about where everything goes.
