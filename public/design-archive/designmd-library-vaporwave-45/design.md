## Overview

Vaporwave aesthetic interface. Ideal for landing pages, saas. AI-ready template. Vaporwave didn't start as a design movement. It started as a joke — or maybe a critique disguised as one. Around 2010-2012, anonymous producers on Bandcamp and Reddit began chopping up forgotten muzak, Japanese city pop, and late-night infomercial audio into something deliberately uncanny. The visuals followed: Roman busts, Windows 95 dialogs, dead mall interiors, all rendered in that signature pink-purple haze. Tumblr ran with it. Hard.

The thing is, beneath the irony sat a genuine observation about consumer culture. Vaporwave was sampling the aesthetic residue of hypercapitalism — the smooth jazz of hold music, the empty promises of 80s advertising, the hollow optimism of early digital interfaces. It asked: what happens when you strip commercial media of its intent and just... stare at it?

What nobody expected was longevity. By the mid-2010s, vaporwave's palette and spatial language had migrated into legitimate brand work, album art, indie games, and UI experiments. The meme became a vocabulary. Designers who'd never heard of Macintosh Plus were pulling from its color theory — those saturated cyans against deep magentas, the deliberate digital decay. It proved that internet subcultures could produce lasting visual frameworks, not just disposable trends.

- **z-index contract:** base (0) / sticky-nav (100) / overlay (200) / modal (300) / toast (500).


## Elevation & Depth

text-shadow glow, linear-gradient, filter: hue-rotate(), glitch animations, retro scan lines

- **Physics:** Spring — stiffness 120, damping 20. Confident, weighted transitions.
- **Entry animations:** Fade + translate-Y (16px → 0) over 480ms ease-out. Staggered cascades for lists: 100ms between items.
- **Hover states:** Scale(1.03) + shadow lift over 200ms.
- **Page transitions:** Fade + slide (300ms).
- **Performance:** Only transform and opacity animated. No layout-triggering properties.


## Shapes

Base corner radius: 8px. See rounded tokens in front matter for the full scale.


## Components

- **Primary Button:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) shape. Accent color fill. Hover: 8% darken + subtle lift shadow. Active: -1px translate tactile press. Font weight 600. No outer glows.
- **Secondary / Ghost Button:** Outline variant. 1.5px border in muted color. Text in primary color. Hover: subtle background fill.
- **Cards:** Subtly rounded (0.5rem) corners. Surface background. Subtle shadow (0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)). 1px border stroke.
- **Inputs:** Label above input. 1px border stroke. Focus ring: 2px accent color offset 2px. Error text below in semantic red. No floating labels.
- **Navigation:** Primary surface background. Active item: accent color indicator. Font weight 500 when active.
- **Skeletons:** Shimmer animation matching component dimensions. No circular spinners.
- **Empty States:** Icon-based composition with descriptive text and action button.


## Do's and Don'ts

- No emojis in UI — use icon system only (Lucide, Heroicons)
- No pure white (#FFFFFF) backgrounds — use off-white or dark surfaces
- No oversaturated accent colors (saturation cap: 80%)
- No 3-column equal-width feature layouts — use zig-zag or asymmetric grid
- No `h-screen` — use `min-h-[100dvh]`
- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Sunset gradient present
- Do Neon glow applied
- Do Retro grid visible
- Do Glitch effects subtle
- Do Dreamy atmosphere
- Do 80s-90s aesthetic
