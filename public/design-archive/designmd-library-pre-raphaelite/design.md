## Overview

Pre-Raphaelite visual system, translated from the Claude Artisan catalog for use in digital products. Deep saturated jewel-tone palette (emerald, crimson, gold), built up like glazed paint; Dense, specific botanical motifs framing content, not repeating as flat pattern

- **Category:** historical
- **Era:** 1848–1880s
- **Origin:** England, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (Rossetti, Millais, Holman Hunt, Burne-Jones) — a rejection of academic painting in favor of jewel-toned color, medieval-romantic subjects, and minute botanical detail.
- **Reference:** Rossetti's Proserpine and Beata Beatrix; Millais's Ophelia; Burne-Jones's The Golden Stairs.
- **Structural base:** hero, superfície, conteúdo e grade responsiva

**Defining traits:**
- Deep saturated jewel-tone palette (emerald, crimson, gold), built up like glazed paint
- Dense, specific botanical motifs framing content, not repeating as flat pattern
- Flowing organic linework (hair, vines, drapery) softening hard edges; medieval-romantic, painterly mood

## Typography

- Display: Cormorant Garamond, EB Garamond, serif
- Body: EB Garamond, Cormorant Garamond, serif
- Mono: ui-monospace, monospace

## Layout

- hero, superfície, conteúdo e grade responsiva
- Use a responsive grid and preserve content hierarchy.
- Collapse columns below 768px without horizontal overflow.

## Elevation & Depth

- Deep saturated jewel-tone palette (emerald, crimson, gold), built up like glazed paint; Dense, specific botanical motifs framing content, not repeating as flat pattern; Flowing organic linework (hair, vines, drapery) softening hard edges; medieval-romantic, painterly mood; sombras e elevação; transparência e blur

## Shapes

- Radius scale: 2px, 8px, 20px.

## Components

- Buttons keep visible focus and predictable hover/pressed states.
- Cards use the surface and radius scale from the tokens.
- Forms expose persistent labels, textual errors, and keyboard focus.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do: follow the tokens and the structural composition.
- Do: maintain WCAG AA contrast and `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Avoid: using the style as decoration without functional hierarchy.
